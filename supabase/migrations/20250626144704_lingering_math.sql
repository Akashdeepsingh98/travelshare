/*
  # Fix infinite recursion in community_members RLS policies

  1. Policy Issues Fixed
    - Remove recursive policy references that cause infinite loops
    - Simplify policies to use direct conditions only
    - Ensure policies don't reference the same table they're protecting

  2. Security Changes
    - Maintain proper access control without recursion
    - Allow users to view community members of communities they belong to
    - Allow approved users to join public communities
    - Allow community admins to manage members

  3. Changes Made
    - Drop existing problematic policies
    - Create new simplified policies without recursive references
